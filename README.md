# Text Digger
***Text Digger*** is an open-source, cross-platform software designed to streamline text searches. Ideal for developers, researchers, and power users, it combines powerful text search functionalities with versatile tools such as text replacement, file deletion, file opening, and path copying.

## Features

Text Digger offers robust options for narrowing search results:

    *   Specify date ranges using flexible conditions like "before," "after," or "between." 
*   **Size Filters**:
    *   Find files based on size, supporting units from bytes to gigabytes. 
    *   Customize size conditions like "greater than" or "less than."
*   **Type Filters**:
    *   Limit searches to specific MIME types (e.g., text, csv, xml, html, etc...).
    *   Add, remove, or reset MIME type configurations.
