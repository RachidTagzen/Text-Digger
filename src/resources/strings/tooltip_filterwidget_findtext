		<b>Case Sensitive:</b> 'Example' and 'example' are treated as different
		strings.<br />
		<i>Example:</i> Searching for 'Apple' will not return results containing
		'apple' or 'APPLE'. Use this option to find case-specific terms, e.g., if
		looking for a product name 'Orange Juice' you won't get results for 'orange
		juice'.<br /><br />
		<b>Case Insensitive:</b> 'Example' and 'example' are treated as the same
		string.<br />
		<i>Example:</i> Searching for 'Apple' will return results containing
		'apple', 'APPLE', or 'Apple'. Use this option for broader searches where the
		exact casing doesnâ€™t matter, such as looking for 'contact' to get all
		variations like 'Contact' or 'CONTACT'.<br /><br />
		<b>Regular Expression:</b> Use regular expressions to define complex search
		patterns.<br />
		<i>Example:</i> Searching for '\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}' will return any matches
		for a pattern like '123-45-6789', useful for finding social security numbers
		or similar formats.<br /><br />
		<b>Wildcard:</b> Use wildcards (e.g., * and ?) for pattern matching in your
		text searches.<br />
		<i>Example:</i> Searching for 'App*' will return results like 'Apple',
		'Application', and 'Appetizer'. If you want to find terms that start with
		'App', this is the option to use.<br /><br />
		<b>Fixed String:</b> Search for an exact string match without any pattern
		interpretation.<br />
		<i>Example:</i> Searching for 'Apple Juice' will return results containing
		exactly 'Apple Juice', excluding 'apple juice' or 'Apple' and 'Juice'
		separately. This is ideal for precise product names or phrases.
